This is a python-based project using the [web2py](http://www.web2py.com) framework, created over the course of about four months for the third-year Interactive Application Programming Techniques (IAPT) module.

The IAPT module focuses on application design techniques such as building personas and scenarios, using popular design patterns such as those introduced by [Tog](http://asktog.com/atc/principles-of-interaction-design) and [Neilsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics) and evaluative reviews such as [Collaborative Heuristic Evaluations](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224849786_Collaborative_Heuristic_Evaluation_improving_the_effectiveness_of_heuristic_evaluation) and [Task-Based User Evaluations](http://www.sigchi.org/chi97/proceedings/tutorial/pj.htm).
